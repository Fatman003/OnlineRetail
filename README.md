The data above contains some information about an online retail business which has its presence in over 30 countries including the United Kingdom. The purpose of this task was to clean, visualize, analyse and derive compeling insights from the data.

  Since the data isnt too voluminous, I have done the preprocessing & cleaning to remove the redundancy and bad data using the Power Query feature of PowerBI. Other methods that could have been used include Excel or Python which I am equally skilled at.
  
  The online retail data was extracted from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/citation_policy.html. [Daqing Chen, Sai Liang Sain, and Kun Guo, Data mining for the online retail industry: A case study of RFM model-based customer segmentation using data mining, Journal of Database Marketing and Customer Strategy Management, Vol. 19, No. 3, pp. 197â€“208, 2012 (Published online before print: 27 August 2012. doi: 10.1057/dbm.2012.17)]
